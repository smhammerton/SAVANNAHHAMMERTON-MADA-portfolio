<h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
<p>While it does not appear in the <code>glimpse()</code> output, viewing the overall data set showed <em>many</em> repeated rows. Each row contains only one author, so any paper that had more than one author is repeated until each other has its own row. The same appears to happening with any other variable that has more than one option per paper. I want to reduce these down so each paper has only one row.</p>
<p>To do this, I’m creating a function that will effectively reduce multiple data points of a certain variable (that will be grouped by some other variable) to one character string, each separated by “,”. I will then apply that function to each variable I want to include in my new data set.</p>

<p>This looks much more manageable! I want to primarily use this new data set in my exploratory analysis. Now I can start checking out frequencies within the data set, as before the results would have been effected by the repeats in the set.</p>

<h3>Authors</h3>
<p>First, I’ll look at how many authors are typically in each paper.</p>

<p>Looks like there are generally less than five, with a few ranging up to beyond 15.</p>
</div>
<div id="categories" class="section level3">
<h3>Categories</h3>
<p>Next, I’ll do the same with paper categories.</p>

<p><img src="tidytuesday_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Similarly, the bulk of papers had limited categories, usually one, but a couple had more (no more than 4).</p>

<h2>More Visualization</h2>
<p>Since I haven’t done much work with text data before, I wanted to have fun with this data set, and decided to make some word clouds showing what the most common words were in paper titles. This required some looking to understand how to get the data into a format I needed, but allowed me to find the book <em>Text Mining with R</em>, which can be found <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">here</a>!</p>
<p>In order to create a word cloud, I need to unnest the titles into individual tokens so I have one taken per row in a new data set. I then need another column with the corresponding counts of each word. Finally, I will have the words sorted with highest counts at the top.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>titlefreq <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="co">#set name of new object </span></span>

<p>Looking at this list, it looks like stop words generally have the highest counts. I’m not interested in those for my word cloud, so I need to remove them. While I’m at it, I also want to remove any numbers there may be from the titles.</p>

<p>I’m really happy with how this turned out, particularly because it’s interactive! I can run my cursor over a word and see how many times it occurred in the titles.</p>

<div id="getting-more-specific" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting More Specific</h2>
<p>I’m interested in seeing if there are differences in the major title words in each category. First, I need to see what categories I should use!</p>

<p>I’m going to focus on just the individual categories, so I’ll create data sets with unnested title words for the categories ‘Micro’, ‘Finance’, and ‘Macro/International.’</p>

<h2>Final Thought and Notes</h2>
<p>There are definitely differences in the different categories! A lot of the words show up in all three categories, but in different amounts. Evidence seems to be the most common in the micro category as well as overall. Finance and Macro/International seem to be a little more spread out, with Finance seeing high amounts of “risk,” “market,” and “evidence,” and Macro/International seeing “policy,” “trade,” and “exchange” in large numbers.</p>
<p>This was challenging, as I needed to learn a lot of new skills to get to the end point, but I thought this would be a really interesting way to visualize the data, and it certainly didn’t disappoint!</p>
<p>As a note to anyone interested in replicating this or using the <code>wordcloud2</code> package - showing more than one wordcloud in the document got a little tricky. I found that everything would show up no problem in the .Rmd document, but when I tried to knit to HTML, only the first one appeard; the other three showed up as large white blank spaces. After <em>a lot</em> of fiddling and searching, I found that others had the same problem when using more than one wordcloud in their documents. <a href="https://github.com/Lchiffon/wordcloud2/issues/65">Here</a> is the issue on GitHub. In the end, installing <code>devtools::install_github("gaospecial/wordcloud2")</code> got all four of my wordclouds to show up.</p>
<p>This week involved some serious practice in troubleshooting and creative problem solving! I hope to participate in Tidy Tuesday every week so some extent from now on to continue getting this sort of practice and experience.</p>
